			<p>Hi! I'm Edward Cox, a computer science graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in machine learning. I am looking for a software engineering internship during the summer or school year. My programming experience includes building web apps using Amazon Web Services and creating mobile apps such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stargutsymphony.trainbaronv2">this</a> train game made using the Unity game engine. I'm a fun loving person though my stern and concentrated face in front of the computer would never give you the clue. Whenever I'm outdoors you'll probably find me hiking or playing pickup basketball. </p>

		<h2>Train Baron</h2>
		<div id="tower">
			<p>This strategy game made with the Unity game engine features retro graphics and limitless levels that get progressively harder. The goal of the game is to complete train routes under deadline. While creating this game, organizing the layout and accounting for changing game tiles was definitely a challenge. I had to create distinct arrays for distinct game objects such as train tracks and industry pieces. I learned a lot about Unity's API and creating maintainable and reusable code through this project. It has been <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stargutsymphony.trainbaronv2">published</a> on the Google Play Store.</p>

		<div id="steele">
			<p>I created an Android app that enables offline storage and retrieval of real estate listings using Salesforce Mobile SDK. The Salesforce SDK is very handy because it takes care of user authentication, which allowed me to concentrate on improving user experience. I did run into some challenges, however, such as implementing remote connectivity. I used SmartStore from the SDK, which allowed offline synchronization between my device's local storage and the Salesforce database. </p>

			<p>Ultimately I was able to roll out an app that Steele Consulting's CEO could use to look up real estate listings in the field regardless of whether he had internet connection or not. The app also reduces the lengthy process of loggingin in via the Salesforce account and navigating to the listings section.  </p>
